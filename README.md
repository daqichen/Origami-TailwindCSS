#### `origami-tailwindcss` is a template [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/) project to learn about the ancient art of origami, the project leverages [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make it more readable and easier to maintain.

**NOTICE:**
The template is currently undergoing initial development, therefore is not yet ready-for-use, if there are any suggestions/questions, please feel free to reach out!

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
