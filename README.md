# [Origami Tailwind CSS](https://year2024-eta.vercel.app/)

<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/daqichen/year2024/assets/55526292/7eb36c17-dcbd-4f86-95c8-5e37bf52c97e">

#### `origami-tailwindcss` is a minimal UI component library that leverages the capabilities of [tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It offers a minimal set of components and exposes the tailwind CSS style classes behind each for developers to modify.

`origami-tailwindcss` joins Tailwind CSS with Typescript to allow more readability and code reusability. It also offers a minimal set of components.

**NOTICE:**
The library is currently undergoing initial development, therefore is not yet available, the pending work needed is drafted below and if there are any suggestions/questions, please feel free to reach out!

## TODOs:
- [ ] Creating initial components offerings (Tessellation 1 out of 10 done, Pop-up 1 out of 5 done)
- [ ] Publish to NPM Registry
- [ ] Testing integration

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
